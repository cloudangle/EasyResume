This is a tiny Ruby on Rails web application for deploying and managing personal online resume (most likely to be useful to New Grad CS Student).




Functions included:

1. Start new resumes
2. Edit existing resumes


I will soon add more fuctions as listed below:

1. Change default resume to display
2. Set up user profile in order to dynamically change names, email, etc
3. Theme color personalization
4. Built-in security features



Default resume that you like to display to others can be set in /config/routes.rb by simply changing the id field in the root path to your resume ID.



This application is built with:

Ruby 2.3.3
Rails 5.1.2
